## Information

Many companies place monetisation as their top priority, but at Kyro, we don't. Wwe understand the financial difficulties associated when starting a new business, which is why we have created a permanent pricing stratergy — we offer a wide range of useful features completely free of charge. As for our premium features, we charge once per workspace. No subscription, no committment; one payment to unlock all of Kyro's top features.

## Pro

Our premium tier is called Pro, and it can be applied to a workspace of your choice upon purchasing it for a one-time fee of **£6**. Pro workspaces unlock a variety of advanced features designed to propell your company forward, and distinguish yourself from others. You can view the extensive list of features we offer to Pro workspaces below.

- **Activity Tracking:** Track your employee's ingame activity to the second. Every join, every leave; it's all logged with Kyro. You can view in-game activity through the staff profiles or directly through a command to view everyone's in-game performance. Additionally, your staff members can also check up on how they're doing.
- **Competitive Leaderboard:** In-game activity and session attendance is what drives your company forward. We offer an accurate leaderboard which ranks your staff members based on their activity which resets weekly. Workspaces which have utilised the leaderboard feature noticed an increase in activity as employees raced to the top. Leaderboards reset when an administrator marks the commencement of a new week.
- **Attendance Logging:** Logging sessions can deter employees from hosting. With Kyro, it's a piece of cake. Through our unique sessions panel, simply tap on the attendance button and ping everyone who attended in one simple message. All attendees will gain a session added to their record and your session will be automatically recorded.
- **Priority Support:** We know every company advertises priority support as a premium feature. However, it's slightly different with Pro — workspace administrators gain access to an exclusive email which notifies all departments and online staff members, sending notifications to all our employees. The average response time for our Pro customers is 72% higher than our free customers.

## Whitelabel

We also offer a subscription-based service called Whitelabel, tailored towards communities who are interested in using Kyro for their group but thrive on unique branding. With Whitelabel, you can host Kyro's infrastructure on your own Discord bot, with all branding removed. The only way they'll find out the bot is powered by Kyro is in the little note we provide in the workspace identification command. Due to the hosting and maintenance costs, we charge **£4** each month for Whitelabel.
