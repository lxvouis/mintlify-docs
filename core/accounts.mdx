## What are Kyro Accounts?

Before you run a command with Kyro, you'll be prompted to create your own Kyro Account with the **/account** command, which opens our Account Portal. Here, you can create an account (if you haven't already done so), update your account details if you have an existing account, or delete your account.

Kyro Accounts are important to ensure that we have a record of everyone using our service. Additionally, this ensures that we are able to disable accounts that don't comply with our Terms of Service.

  Your details are stored in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.kyrohr.cc/extra/privacy). We don't share your information.
