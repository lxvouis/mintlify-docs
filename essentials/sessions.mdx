## Session Panel

Sessions are managed through what we call the Session Panel. You can access the panel through the **/sessions** command. From the session panel, you're able to announce the staff briefing, student join announcement, and log employee attendance.

## Logging Attendance

Through the panel, you can also log staff attendance by using the _Log Attendance_ button. Once you interact with the button, the attendance system will activate, and you have **120 seconds** to complete your log before the system times out. In a nutshell, here's what happens;

  </Step>
  <Step title="Weekly reset">
