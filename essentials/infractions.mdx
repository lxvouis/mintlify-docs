## Issue an infraction

To issue an infraction, simply use the **/infract** command. You can select your infraction type (warning, demotion, suspension or termination), and attach a reason to be associated with the infraction. Once you execute the command, the employee will be automatically notified and their record will be updated. The action will also be logged to the Kyro logging channel.

## View infraction history

Infraction histories are stored in the employee profile's infraction tab. In there, you'll be able to see the infraction type, as well as other details such as the infraction's ID, date of issue, reason and the user who issued the infraction. You can use the infraction ID to delete an infraction.

<Note>
  We never share the username of the infraction issuer to the employee. Only Senior Leaders can view this information through employee profiles.

## Delete an infraction

You can easily delete an infraction via the **/delete-infraction **command. This requires the infraction ID, which can be accessed through the employee profile. Once executed, the employee will be automatically notified and the infraction will be removed from their record. Infraction deletions are logged in the logging channel.
