## Requesting

Requesting an inactivity notice is extremely simple - staff members can use the **/inactivity** command to open the inactivity menu. From there, they can open the request form to submit a request. Staff members will be prompted to input their roleplay name, Roblox username, start/end date, and the reason for their inactivity notice. Kyro automatically identifies the length of the inactivity notice and their Discord details.

## Reviewing

Once the inactivity notice has been requested, it will be sent to the inactivity channel with all the submitted details, and the details Kyro created, attached. You can simply use the _Accept_ or _Decline_ button to process the inactivity request. Once you've done this, the embed will be updated and the employee will be notified.

## Viewing Activity Status

You can check if an employee is active or ianctive by navigating to their profile's inactivity tab. Information regarding their latest inactivity request will be provided. Another simple way is to check the inactivity request channel.
