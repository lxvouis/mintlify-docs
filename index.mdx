## Setting up

Kyro has been built from the ground-up by notable members of the business community, with years of experience. We recognise that customization is essential, which is why we offer free configuration and customization for Kyro. For workspaces that wish to go further, we offer a Whitelabel plan which allows you to host Kyro on your own bot, promoting individuality and branding.
