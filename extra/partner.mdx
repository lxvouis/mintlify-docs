## Introduction

This section of our documentation has been crafted to provide clarification on our partnership standards, as well as express additional information on how to join the partnership program at Kyro. At Kyro, we value professionalism, mutual growth, and collaboration. We remain committed to ensuring that all partnerships reflect these principles.

Our partnership program aims to establish meaningful connections with other communities on the platform. The sections below outline our eligibility criteria, partnership benefits, and the steps your community needs to take if you wish to join the partnership program. We encourage all applicants to review this document before submitting an application.

## Eligiblity

To ensure each connection upholds our partnership values, we require our partners to meet the eligibility criteria below. If your community does not meet our eligibility criteria, please contact our Relations Division to request an exemption from a requirement, or further clarification or support.

- Your group must have an active community. We don't base this off statistics or numbers — instead, once you submit your application, our team will conduct a thorough review on your group. You'll be contacted if further review is required.
- Your group must continuously maintain a positive environment. For example, an automated moderation system should be implemented, and a human staff team to enforce your server guidelines and provide support should always be available. You must also provide a clear and detailed server guidance channel.
- Compliance with Discord Terms of Service & Community Guidelines, Roblox’s Terms of Service & Community Guidelines & Kyro’s Terms of Service & Partnership Standards is compulsory. Groups requesting partnerships with active violations will be immidiately declined and banned from future requests.
- Your group must obtain a positive reputation within the industry. Our team will conduct extensive background checks on both the group and the owner. If you possess a negative reputation, please avoid applying for our partnership program.

## Standards

If your group is accepted to join the partnership program, you must remain in compliance with our partnership standards to avoid consequences being issued by our Relations Division. Our partnerships are built on trust and compliance. Firstly, you must remain active and actively contribute towards the partnership; inactive partnerships are not mutually beneficial and will lead to the termination of the partnership.  Next, you should be willing to fulfill the majority of appropriate requests we give you. For example, we may request for you to announce our team vacancies - in which case, you’re expected to announce them. Finally, you’re required to remain in adherence with our eligibility criteria. If you are no longer eligible for partnership, you’ll be given a grace period before you’re dismissed from the program. The only exception to this standard is if you were exempted from the requirement you’re missing upon joining the program.

## Benefits

As a member of the partnership program, you’re automatically provided a variety of different perks as a token of appreciation. Firstly, you’ll be granted a free **Kyro Pro License**, providing you with access to our exclusive features, including activity tracking, ranking, and advanced staff management features and statistics. Next, your workspace will unlock a **verified status**, meaning that your workspace will have a checkmark next to its name when it appears anywhere on Kyro’s interface. We operate a verification system to help combat fraudulent activity and imposters. Finally, we’ll do our best to promote a mutually beneficial partnership. Partnerships should go both ways, so we’ll return the favour.

## Application

If you’re interested in joining the partnership program at Kyro, we ask that you create a Google Document which contains detailed answers to the questions below. Once you’re happy with your answers, you should then ensure the document is public and send the link to our Relations Division through the email relations@kyrohr.cc. We do not provide Discord assistance for our partnership program.

1. Please provide your Roblox Group and Discord Server links, and ensure they’re permanent and will not expire.
2. Why are you interested in forming an affiliation with Kyro?
3. Why do you believe that an affiliation would be mutually beneficial — why should we accept you?

## Closure

We extend our thorough appreciation for your interest in partnering with Kyro. For any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out to us; you can learn more about our support channels by visiting the contact us channel within our Discord Server. Best of luck if you choose to apply!
