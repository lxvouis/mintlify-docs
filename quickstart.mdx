## Get started with these easy steps

Kyro can be setup from one simple command. Follow our instructions and dive into a world of ro-schooling solutions.

### Follow our simple setup steps

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invite Kyro to your server" icon="hand">
    Firstly, inviting Kyro to your server is cruicial. Complete the [OAuth flow](roblox.com) to have Kyro automatically added to your server. During the process, Kyro will attempt to join with administrator permissions — keep these enabled, or uncheck the box and provide your own permissions. Keep in mind that Kyro requires permissions to function, and selecting administrator will avoid any complications in the future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Kyro" icon="file">
    Configuring Kyro is simple, and can be done via the **/config **command. Please note that the /config command can only be executed by the server owner to prevent abuse. Configuration can also be done through our Development Team, so feel free to contact us if you need assistance. This is the only command which uses Discord permissions — all other commands can be accessed through Kyro permissions, which can be configured through the /config command.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="You're all done" icon="sparkle">
    Kyro has been invited, configured, and is now ready for use in your server\! Dive into the future of ro-schooling with Kyro.
