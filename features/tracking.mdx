## Tracking module

Before you can begin tracking your employees in-game, you'll need to setup the tracking module. This module is setup slightly different to all other modules. **To setup tracking, you need:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pro License" icon="heart">
    Tracking requires your workspace to have an active Pro License. You can grab one with the **/pro** command.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Installed code" icon="file-code">
    You'll need to install the Kyro Tracking script into your experience and enable HTTPS Requests. You can find the module below.

    <Accordion title="Tracking script" icon="code">
      ```lua
      --[[

      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## See the data

Kyro tracks **in-game minutes and messages** for all employees. We currently offer two ways to view this data.

- **Profile:** Visit an employee's profile and open the tracking panel. From there, you can view their weekly activity, all-time activity, message count, and their last 100 messages.
- **Command:** To view their weekly minutes, simply use the _/minutes_ command.
