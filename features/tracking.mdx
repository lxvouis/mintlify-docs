## Tracking module

Before you can begin tracking your employees in-game, you'll need to setup the tracking module. This module is setup slightly different to all other modules. **To setup tracking, you need:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pro License" icon="heart">
    Tracking requires your workspace to have an active Pro License. You can grab one with the **/pro** command.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Install code" icon="file-code">
    You'll need to install the Kyro Tracking script into your experience. To do so, [download](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1390037074739986604/1417963523044151568/d4QfQRk.rbxm?ex=68cc64f0&is=68cb1370&hm=eb71498578c922246741261d7d733ca0151e3c517647f794fa4dcff1272a6645&) the script and place it into *ServerScriptService*. From there, enable HTTPS Requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set ID" icon="hash">
    Create a **StringValue** named `WorkspaceID` as a child of the script. Set the value to your **Discord Server ID**. Once done, you're ready to go!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## See the data

Kyro tracks **in-game minutes and messages** for all employees. We currently offer two ways to view this data.

- **Profile:** Visit an employee's profile and open the tracking panel. From there, you can view their weekly activity, all-time activity, message count, and their last 100 messages.
- **Command:** To view their weekly minutes, simply use the _/minutes_ command.
