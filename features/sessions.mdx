## Session Panel

Sessions are managed through what we call the session panel. You can access the panel through the **/sessions** command if you're a workspace employee. From the session panel, you're able to announce the staff briefing, student join announcement, and log employee attendance.

## Announcements

We currently have two types of sessions; briefings and sessions. A briefing is a staff-only event which takes place before a session, while a session is the main event. For example, if you own an airline and you have a flight at 3PM, you could send your staff briefing at 2.30PM and your session announcement at 3PM. However, we also acknowledge that not everyone will be able to benefit from this, which is why we have a brand new, custom session feature on the way.

## Logging Attendance

Through the panel, you can also log staff attendance by using the **Log Attendance** button. Once you interact with the button, the attendance system will activate, and you have **120 seconds** to complete your log before the system times out. Throughout the whole process, here's what happens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mention all users">
    In the chat, simply ping all staff members who attended your session in one message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatically logged">
    Session attendance is then automatically logged! You can view attendance through employee profiles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Weekly reset">
    You can reset the week with the `/reset-week` command. You can still view everyone's all-time session counts.
  </Step>
