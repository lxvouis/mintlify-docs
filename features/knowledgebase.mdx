## Accessing the knowledgebase

Accessing the knowledgebase is extremely easy. Simply use the **/knowledgebase** command and the knowledgebase panel will be opened ephemerally. Only workspace staff members can view the knowledgebase, and workspace administrators can edit the knowledgebase. The knowledgebase is your central hub to store all your resources in one simple place.

<Note>
  Accessing and configuring the knowledebase can be done in the knowledgebase panel.

## Configuring the knowledgebase

Unlike other modules where you're required to use the configuration panel, all workspace administrators can modify the knowledgebase. Simply head to the knowledgebase and you'll see two buttons, *Add Document* and *Delete Document*. Tap the *Add Document* button to add a name for your resource and the link to it, and it'll be automatically added to the knowledgebase for everyone to see. To remove a document, simply press the *Delete Document* button and choose the resource from the drop-down. Please note that you might need to run the command again to see the changes.
