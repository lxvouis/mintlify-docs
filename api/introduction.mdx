Pro workspaces gain access to Kyro's API, which comes with a variety of endpoints to automate your experience with Kyro even further. Kyro's API allows you to complete various tasks, such as in-game ranking commands, automated group shouts, and so much more. We're excited to present a haul of new possiiblities for developers, using Kyro.

<Warning>Our API is currently in the early stages of development. Access is invite-only with no waitlist.</Warning>
